## Introduction

Server-client for Unity multiplayer projects.<br>

It uses the [SpaceBrew](http://docs.spacebrew.cc/)* toolkit for the server management and the communications between it and the clients.<br>
For the interaction with Unity, the project is based on the [spacebrewUnity](https://github.com/Spacebrew/spacebrewUnity) library.<br>

The SpaceBrew toolkit has been integrated in the project, and its execution can be managed by the Unity project directly (using an [embedded Node.js](//github.com/2-REC/unity-nodejs)*).<br>

(*) The "SpaceBrew" and "Unity Node.js" projects are included in the repository as normal files (not as dependencies/submodules). The corresponding versions can be determined from the timestamps of the last respective commits.
In order to use the latest version, the projects should be downloaded separately. Beware however that the compatibility might not be 100% guaranteed.<br>
It is possible to use external SpaceBrew server and Node.js depending on the used prefabs and their configuration (see below in the "Components" section).<br>
