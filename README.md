# unity-multi

Server-client for Unity multiplayer projects.<br>

It uses the [SpaceBrew](http://docs.spacebrew.cc/) toolkit for the server management and the communications between it and the clients.<br>
For the interaction with Unity, the project is based on the [spacebrewUnity](https://github.com/Spacebrew/spacebrewUnity) library.<br>

The SpaceBrew toolkit has been integrated in the project, and its execution can be managed by the Unity project directly (using an [embedded Node.js](//github.com/2-REC/unity-nodejs)).<br>
(It is still possible to use an external SpaceBrew and Node.js by changing the configuration in the Editor - SEE BELOW - TODO)<br>
